# React Challenge
This is an assignment from Deep Dive Coding Fullstack Cohort 33.

## Summary
* Reinforced practice of creating layouts in React using React-Bootstrap.
* Using React Router to create synthetic routes in a SPA (Single Page Applications).
* JSX trial by fire.

## Brief
1. Create a two-page site that successfully implements the layouts shown in the wireframes in the documentation directory. These pages should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
2. Use React Bootstrap's built in components to the greatest extent possible and only use built in bootstrap classes as a fallback.
4. You can copy snippets from React-Bootstrap's Official Documentation where you need to, BUT no copy/pasting from pre-built templates, other websites, or existing projects.
5. No additional dependencies.
